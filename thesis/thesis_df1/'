\title {\textbf{An Analysis of Chronometric Cosmology and The CMB}}

    \begin{abstract}
        The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is often taken as a
        cornerstone of evidence in contribution to the Standard Model of
        Cosmology. In the standard model, the CMB is taken to be the light last
        scattered from the hot and dense plasma permeating the early universe
        as it cooled approximately 300,000 years after the Big Bang. In this
        paper, however, the CMB is analyzed from an alternative cosmological
        model known as The Chronometric Cosmological model. This model
        considers the cosmos to be a 3-sphere in which light is permitted to
        take several circuits around the universe before potentially
        scattering. It is through the phenomenon of light taking circuits about
        the universe that one can derive the same notion of the CMB in
        this model. Thus, this paper endeavors to utilize this theoretical
        framework to derive first order approximations of the average
        temperature of the CMB as well as it's power spectrum in this model and
        determine whether or not the model is falsified in light of modern
        astrophysical data.

    \section{\textbf{Introduction}}
    In 1927 a paper was published by a man in Belgium in which a compelling
    solution to Einstein's field equations were made. The man behind the paper,
    Georges Lema\^{i}tre, had discovered a solution in which the universe was
    expanding. Unbeknownst to Lema\^{i}tre, however, this solution had already
    been derived several years ago by Alexander Friedmann, but notably,
    Friedmann did not place much weight on his derivation. During the Early
    1920s, Friedmann produced many unique solutions to Einsteins field
    equations, and was largely concerned with the range of possible solutions
    as opposed to which of the bunch could be considered the most physical.
    Lema\^{i}tre, however, attacked the problem of the expanding cosmos in
    order to attempt to understand how an expanding universe would impact
    physical theories \cite{amnh}. 

    Lema\^{i}tre's dedication to pursuing the possibility of an expanding
    universe led him to a rather unique prediction. He supposed that if the
    universe were expanding, the galaxies and other bodies in the cosmos would
    be percieved as \textit{redshifted} due to their outward radial velocity.
    With this he predicted of Hubbles constant and an
    early iteration of what would become Hubble's law \cite{phyouni}. In a
    single paper, Georges Lema\^{i}tre had laid the foundation for what would
    become one of the most robust theories in all of modern physics; The Big
    Bang Cosmological Model, or what is, today, commonly referred to as the
    Standard Cosmological Model (SCM). Over the course of a century the SCM
    would change form slightly, adapting to more and more astrophysical
    data, however it still remains a titan in the field of cosmology whose
    predictive capabilities still have no true rival.
    
    %Astrophysics as a field is facing one of the most exciting times in history
    %where the development of increasingly sophisticated technology has ushered
    %in measurements with accuracy previously unknown to humankind. In
    %particular, the launch and initialization of the James Web Space Telescope
    %(JWST) in December 2021 and throughout early 2022 has been a revolutionary
    %moment in modern astrophysics. Since then, JWST has provided physicists of
    %various fields countless opportunities to verify or otherwise test the
    %validity of modern cosmology to an even higher degree of accuracy than the
    %previous generation of orbital telescopes has allowed. Among these theories
    %we find the Standard Cosmological Model (SCM) (also called $\Lambda CDM$ or
    %the Big Bang Theory); a true giant in the field of cosmology.
    

    %\begin{center}
    %    [This whole section needs reworking because the transition here doesn't
    %    make sense,,, need to add a section here to tie it together more]
    %\end{center}

    The SCM posits that the universe was once an incredibly dense sea of
    energy, too dense in fact for the formation of familiar matter to take
    place. This dense sea of energy eventually underwent a period of rapid
    inflation thus beginning the universe as we know it. This exponentially
    expanding cosmic soup of energy would eventually slow it's rate of
    inflation allowing the matter within it to cool substantially causing more
    familiar states of matter to form. Over the span of billions of years, this
    matter would take form as stars, galaxies, quasars, and all the other
    wonderful celestial bodies humanity has been familiarizing ourselves with
    over the last several millennium.

    Along with the large structure formation of the universe, the SCM notably
    can predict two of the largest cosmological phenomena. The first being the
    previously alluded to cosmological redshift. The cosmological redshift in
    the SCM is considered to be a byproduct of the expanding cosmos where the
    spectra of light is redshifted as the light travels through the expanding
    universe. Heuristically it is often described as though the wavelength of
    the light is being stretched as the space it travels through expands. This
    redshift has a distinct pattern, and in 1929 Hubble would define it
    characteristically through Hubble's Law, solidifying the redshift relation
    in the SCM as a linear relationship given by

    \begin{equation}
        v = H_0D
    \end{equation}
    
    for $D$ the proper distance, $v$ the recessional velocity, and $H_0$ the
    Hubble parameter. 

    The second phenomena that has served a critical role in the
    formulation of the SCM is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The CMB in
    a completely phenomenological context is a faint glow of microwave
    frequency light permeating the universe. It has a spectrum which is very
    nearly a black body spectrum of temperature $\sim 2.7$ K. However, the CMB
    exhibits fluctuations in temperature on the order of $10^{-5}$ K
    \cite{cmb4ped}.

    In the SCM, the CMB is explained in the context of the Big Bang and the
    years nearly following the first moments of the universe. Principally it is
    considered to be the last scattering of light in the early universe as the
    hot ionized matter in the universe gradually cooled. Eventually, it would
    cool enough to deionize allowing it to become transparent to radiation.
    Thus light would scatter freely to form the CMB which we see in microwave
    telescopes today \cite{cmb4ped}. This explanation is widely considered to
    be the most plausible, and it's predictive capabilities is one of the many
    reasons the SCM has become such a pillar of cosmology.

    The CMB, along with the cosmological redshift, make up two of the most
    physically important phenomena in modern cosmology, and the derivation and
    explanation of them is critical for any theory which wishes to exert
    explanatory power in the field. Few theoretical frameworks exist which can
    aptly do so, however few is far from none, and if a potential model proposes an
    explanation of the universe which is able to reproduce these crucial
    phenomena, it is worthy of investigation.

    
    \subsection{Organization of this thesis}
    This thesis centers around one such alternate cosmological model and in
    particular it's ability to offer a sufficient explanation for the
    CMB in a universe far outside the current mainstream of
    modern cosmology. The model itself is known as the Chronometric
    Cosmological Model (CCM) and is class of models which is of positive
    (spherical) curvature. Further, it is a completely static model and thus
    has no conception of the expansion or contraction of the universe or any
    notion of a beginning to the universe. It is considered infinite
    temporally.

    This thesis will first discuss the Big Bang model and some of it's
    pertinent mathematical properties, then move into the Chronometric Model.
    The Chronometric Model's mathematical properties will be discussed without
    explicitly deriving them (an exercise best left to someone of a more purely
    mathematical inclination). The discussion will then turn to deriving
    certain important equations in dealing this this universe, namely the
    "Area" and "Volume" of the cosmos in this model, and a method of acquiring
    averages over this universe. It will then be possible, using averaging
    techniques, to make certain determinations about the CMB in the CCM, which
    will be discussed in section 3.

    Section 4 will then concern itself with the power spectrum of the CMB and
    how possible calculations of this spectrum are impacted based on various
    parameters. Finally, we will concluding with a general discussion of the
    limits and implications of the contents of this thesis in the scope of
    modern cosmology, along with further points of research to be explored.

    A pertinent question might be related to why this thesis will not be
    discussing aspects of the cosmological redshift. The reason for this is due
    to a preexisting (and rather complete) discussion of the redshift having
    already been conducted by a research colleague Maxwell Kaye in \cite{kaye}
    and also in Segal \cite{segal_b}

    \newpage

    \section{\textbf{The Models}}
    In science theories are formulated to explain phenomena and are constantly
    tested through empirical observation and experimentation. Robust theories
    that can successfully explain and predict the observed phenomena are
    generally not subject to modification or reformulation, while theories that
    fail to do so are subject to revision or replacement. Thus, a natural
    question to arise when discussing alternate cosmological models is:
    \textit{what exactly is wrong with the current model}?

    The answer, truthfully, is a rather limited. As stated previously, the SCM
    has proven to be a reliable and robust framework for understanding the
    universe. It has successfully predicted and explained a wide spread of
    phenomena. This is not to say, however, that the model does not have any
    unresolved issues. Over the course of the last century, many such issues
    have been resolved, but as telescopes continue probing deeper and deeper into
    universe with progressively more advanced means of measurement, they may
    yet find more unsolved mysteries.

    One such example which has become pertinent quite recently is relating to
    large structure formation in the early universe. The James Webb Space
    Telescope (JWST) in a recent paper has discovered a set of galaxies of
    uncharacteristically large mass given their redshift. The paper titled
    \textit{A population of red candidate massive galaxies $\sim$600 Myr after the
    Big Bang} by Labb\`{e} et al. reported...

    \begin{displayquote}
        Galaxies with stellar masses as high as $\sim 10^{11}$ solar masses
        have been identified out to redshifts z $\sim$ 6, approximately one
        billion years after the Big Bang... Here we make use of the 1-5 $\mu$m
        coverage of the JWST early release observations to search for 
        intrinsically red galaxies in the first $\approx$ 750 million years of cosmic
        history. In the survey area, we find six candidate massive galaxies
        (stellar mass $> 10^{10}$ solar masses) at $7.4 \le z \le 9.1$, 500–700 Myr
        after the Big Bang, including one galaxy with a possible stellar mass
        of $\sim 10^{11}$  solar masses. If verified with spectroscopy, the stellar
        mass density in massive  galaxies would be much higher than
        anticipated from previous studies based on rest frame
        ultraviolet-selected samples.
    \end{displayquote}

    In all, the paper goes on to describe possible explanations for such a
    discrepancy at such a large redshift, but in general we can see this as a
    clear example of how possible mysteries can arise in modern cosmology
    \cite{labbe}.

    Another example of unresolved issues in the SCM can be found in the
    cosmological redshift. For much of the model's existence, the cosmological
    redshift has existed as means by which light loses energy by no apparently
    mechanism. The wavelength of the light is simply "stretched" causing it's
    energy to seemingly vanish into the cosmos. This problem would eventually
    be dubbed the \textit{cosmic sink} by Hermann Bondi, and it is a problem
    which has led to dissatisfaction by some physicists. One of which was
    Irving Segal who was troubled by this apparent violation of the
    conservation of energy. In hopes of restoring this grand scale energy
    conservation, Segal developed the Chronometric Cosmology\footnotemark, which is
    precisely where this story picks up. 

    \footnotetext{This development was primarily conducted via his 1976 book
    \textit{Mathematical Cosmology and Extragalactic Astronomy}\cite{segal_b},
    however much of the mathematical framework regarding the CMB is found in other
    papers such as \cite{segal_cmb} and \cite{segal_spinor}}

    this}

    




    %The Chronometric Cosmological Model is one that describes a universe
    %vastly different in character than that which most are used to. As such it
    %is worth devoting a portion of this writing to a qualitative description of

    \section{\textbf{The Cosmic Microwave Background}}
    \subsection{Determination of Black Body}
    \subsection{Average Temperature of CMB}
    
    The average temperature of the CMB is a critical aspect of the CMB as a
    phenomenon in the universe. This, along with the power spectrum characterize
    the primary features of the CMB, and thus, if the chronometric model is able to
    reproduce these aspects of the CMB, we can say that the model is, if nothing
    else, not falsified in light of modern astrophysical data. In order to
    determine these attributes from first principle, however, it is important to
    first get the bigger picture of how the CMB is accounted for within this model.
    
    Light in the chronometric cosmos is broadly separated into two categories. The
    first we call pristine light, and the second we call residual. We call the
    light that has taken fewer than one half-cycle about the cosmos pristine and
    the light which has passed the $\rho = \pi$ manifold distance residual. The CMB
    then is concerned primarily with the residual light in the universe. 
    
    Given the relative sparsity of matter in the universe, light of this category
    would be able to take many circuits about the universe. The infinite time for
    this high-dispersion radiation to accumulate would directly imply that it is
    qualitatively distributed in accordance to Planck’s law, and thus is in fact a
    black body spectrum.  
    
    \begin{center}
        [This will initiate the section on Plank law and that general
        calculation].  
    \end{center}
    
    It is worth noting before continuing that the origin of this light is
    unimportant for general considerations.  However for a more specific analysis
    we can easily consider the source of the pristine and residual  light in the
    universe to be the galaxies and other luminous matter in the universe. 
    
    To show that the residual light is characteristic of a black body spectrum, we
    need only point to the stochastic nature of of the emission and motion of
    galaxies and other luminous material.

    \begin{center}
        [This will end the Planck law calculation and start the extinction
        calculation]. 
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Methodology}
    
    The  methodology, then, for determining the average temperature of the CMB
    in this model will be to utilize the residual light in the cosmos. The
    residual light will be considered explicitly as the light "left over" after
    traversing multiple half circuits of the cosmos, and is thus the
    light which has \textit{not} gone extinct. The residual light is considered
    to be of particular importance as, given the curvature of $\bar{M}$, it is
    allowed to continue traversing the universe becoming of higher and higher
    dispersion, directly contributing to the CMB.

    This analysis will be quite general and is only intended to act as a first
    order approximation to the average temperature to the CMB. As such, a
    handful of approximations must be clarified. We will consider
    all galaxies to be \textit{approximately} the same in radius ($d$),
    luminosity ($L$), and have an explicit number count ($N$). Each galaxy is
    approximated as a perfect absorbing sphere as well as an emitter of light.
    Using these factors we will calculate on average the amounts of pristine
    and residual light in the universe, and what of that reaches the Earth
    which will give us qualitative information regarding the CMB in this model.
    We will then utilize that to determine a range of values for the average
    temperature of the CMB.

    \subsubsection{Extinction Law}
    For a general order of magnitude estimate of the total radiative flux of
    the CMB which arrives at the Earth in the $\mathbb{S}^3$ cosmos, we first
    need to consider extinction of light as light takes half-circuits about
    the closed universe. 

    In general, we know that that the rate of change of photons ($N_p$)
    traversing $\bar{M}$ will be negative and proportional to the number of
    half-circuits ($n$) in accordance with general stochastic
    absorption of light. Using this simple relationship we can construct the
    following.
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{dN_p}{dn} = -\alpha n \; \longrightarrow\; N=N_{p_0}e^{-\alpha n}
    \end{equation*}
    For $N_{p_0}$ the amount of light which has not yet taken a half circuit
    about the universe, which formally makes it the pristine light $P$. This
    allows us to consider the total amount of scattered light $N_{p_0}-N$.
    \begin{equation*}
        N_{p_0}-N = N_{p_0}-N_{p_0}e^{-\alpha n} \approx N_{p_0}e^{-\alpha n}
    \end{equation*}
    With the identification of $N_{p_0}$ as the pristine light $P$, we can then
    arrive at the following expression for extinction of light in the universe.
    \begin{equation}
        Pe^{-\alpha n}
    \end{equation}
    This expression is of course per half-circuit $n$. For the purposes of
    determining the extinction of light over any $n$ circuits the summation
    to infinity must be taken. For the purposes of this analysis, $n$ will be
    taken to start at 1 as this must be an examination of the residual light
    implying one half-circuit has been taken.
    \begin{equation*}
        P\; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\alpha n} = P \left[e^{-\alpha} +
            e^{-2\alpha} + \cdots \right] = \frac{P}{1-e^{-\alpha}} 
    \end{equation*}
    In order to further simplify this expression an approximation
    via Taylor Series expansion is utilized. Given the Taylor series expansion
    for $e^{-\alpha}$, the following is known.
    \begin{equation*}
        e^{-\alpha} = 1 - \alpha + O[\alpha]^2
    \end{equation*}
    From here all greater order terms will be taken as negligible as Segal
    determined that for general considerations $\alpha$ is considerably less
    than one \cite{segal_b}. Removing the higher order terms in this
    approximation allows for a massive simplification in the given expression
    leaving us with the following.
    \begin{equation}
        P\alpha^{-1}
    \end{equation}
    Before continuing on to determine what exactly these parameters are in the
    context of the CCM, we should stop briefly to consider the physical meaning
    of this expression.

    In typical considerations of the standard flat Minkowski spacetime $M$, as
    light radiates away from emitters, it is free to traverse the infinite
    plane of the cosmos until it is scattered. Thus, the average amount of light will
    always decrease irrespective of continuous emission of light from other
    sources in the cosmos. However, in the case of $\bar{M}$, light is permitted
    to continue taking circuits about the universe while the emitters continue
    radiating. This shows us that the residual light will contribute to the net
    luminous flux over many cycles, which is precisely what allows the CMB to
    take form in the CCM. In this way, we can consider that from the
    theoretical framework of Segal's model, the CMB is not merely explained,
    but it is, in fact, \textit{predicted}.

    The next steps, then, are of course to consider how we can determine the
    approximate values for the pristine and residual light from the principles
    already discussed in the CCM.

    \subsubsection{Residual Light Calculation}

    To start, we consider how one can calculate the residual light in the
    cosmos. As stated before, we consider this light to be the light which has
    \textit{not} gone extinct. In this case, then, we need only consider the
    amount of light that arrives at the Earth, as this is the only light which
    we can factor into the chronometric model's explanation of the CMB. In
    order to calculate this, then, we can shift the question to be how much
    light is absorbed by galaxies in the universe en route to the Earth?

    We consider the general volume\footnotemark of $\mathbb{S}^3$  as a
    function of the manifold distance $\rho$.

    \footnotetext{Explicitly we should be calling this the hypervolume and
    consequently the hypersurface and hypersurface area. However, for the
    sake of readability and writing slightly more succinctly, we will
    generally refer to the hypersurface area and hypervolume as surface
    area and volume respectively}

    \begin{equation}
        V(\rho) = 2 \pi R^3 \left[\rho-\cos(\rho)\sin(\rho)\right]\footnotemark
    \end{equation}

    \footnotetext{It is worth noting that in Segal's own work he develops a
        slightly different equation for the volume of $\mathbb{S}^3$. The exact
        expression he derives, however, is only a modulus of the expression we have
        derived in the context of this thesis, and is thus treated as only varying
        by some constants (in this case it varies by $4 \pi R^3$). It will
        later become apparent that these constants are of little significance to
        the endpoint of this calculation.}

    We can then characterize the surface area as follows...
    \begin{equation}
        A(\rho) = 4 \pi R^3 \sin^2(\rho)
    \end{equation}
    As we have derived previously, we can utilize these expressions to develop
    a general expression for the normalized surface area over $\mathbb{S}^3$.
    We derive the following normalization factor over the integral from $0$ to
    $\pi$ (ie the entire surface).
    \begin{equation}
        Q = \int^\pi_0 A(\rho) \;d\rho
          = \int^\pi_0 4 \pi R^3 \sin^2(\rho) \;d\rho
          = 2 \pi^2 R^3
    \end{equation}
    From here we can find the average value of any function of $\rho$ by
    utilizing this normalization factor in the following way.
    \begin{equation}
        F(\rho) = \int_0^\pi \frac{A(\rho)}{Q} \; f(\rho) \;d\rho
    \end{equation}
    Where the integral goes from 0 to $\pi$ for the sake of averaging over the
    entire surface.

    With this framework we can now turn our attention to what exactly it is we
    wish to be finding the average value of. It has been noted that we are
    interested in the amount of light occluded by our approximated galaxy
    objects at any given point in the cosmos (for posterity we consider Earth
    to be our point of relevance). Thus we are interested purely in the
    percentage of the sky taken up by such objects, and therefore we want to
    know the percentage of solid angle taken up by $N$ galaxies.

    We define the solid angle as the field of view obstructed by an object at
    some distance. In the consideration of celestial bodies, we can simply take
    the solid angle to be given as follows.
    \begin{equation*}
        \Omega = 2\pi\left(1-\cos(\theta)\right) = 4\pi\sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) 
    \end{equation*}
    We now consider that for any general consideration of a distribution of
    galaxies, we can consider them to be quite far away. Thus, utilizing small
    angle approximations, we can arrive at the following.
    \begin{equation}
        \Omega = \pi \theta^2
    \end{equation}
    Or the area of the central cross section of our sphere typically called the
    great circle of our sphere. In this approximation, $\theta$ is
    characterizing the radius of of the great circle of the sphere. Thus
    $\theta$ is formally $d$ in the small angle approximation.

    For considerations of the ratio of the sky obstructed by the absorbing
    spheres, we must carefully consider the geometry of the situation. If it
    were the case that we were in typical flat Minkowski space $M$, then we
    would take no issue and simply take our ratio with respect to the total
    surface area of the sphere which we project or solid angle onto. However,
    given that, in $\bar{M}$ an object at $\rho=\frac{\pi}{4}$ and an object at
    $\rho=\frac{3\pi}{4}$ will take up the same $\Omega$, we must utilize the
    surface area component of $\mathbb{S}^3$. Thus, our equation for the ratio
    of solid angle obstructed by a single spherical absorber of radius $d$
    becomes the following.
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\Omega}{\Omega_{total}} = \frac{\pi d^2}{4 \pi R^3 \sin^2(\rho)} 
    \end{equation*}
    Thus for a general case of $N$ such bodies we arrive at...
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\Omega}{\Omega_{total}} = \frac{N \pi d^2}{4 \pi R^3 \sin^2(\rho)} 
    \end{equation*}
    Now we can consider the average based on our formulation of equation (5)
    substituting $\frac{\Omega}{\Omega_{total}}$ for $f(\rho)$. 
    \begin{equation*}
        F_{\Omega}(\rho) = \int_0^\pi \frac{A(\rho)}{Q} 
        \;        \frac{\Omega}{\Omega_{total}}  \;d\rho 
                 = \int_0^\pi \frac{N d^2}{2 \pi R^3} \;d\rho
    \end{equation*}
    Thus...
    \begin{equation}
        F_{\Omega}(\rho)= \frac{N d^2}{2 R^3} 
    \end{equation}
    This value for the average absorption of light is in fact exactly 
    identified as the residual light $\alpha$ in (3).


    \subsubsection{Pristine Light Calculation}
    The consideration of the pristine light in the cosmos will follow very
    similarly to the former as the calculation is yet another average over the
    cosmos. Now, however, it is not about their properties as absorbers, but
    instead their properties as emitters. 

    As stated, we consider each galaxy to have identical properties for the
    sake of a first (or zeroth) order calculation. As such we take each galaxy
    to have uniform luminosity $L$, and define their flux as follows.
    \begin{equation}
        \phi = \frac{L}{4 \pi R^3 \sin^2(\rho)} 
    \end{equation}
    For now, we will characterize our expression not in terms of the luminosity,
    but instead in terms of flux. General considerations in of the average
    pristine light in terms of luminosity will be conducted, however for now it
    suffices to consider our average over with flux in mind.

    Given that the Earth itself rests in the Milky Way galaxy, and ultimately
    our interests are centered around determining values for the average
    temperature of the CMB as detected on Earth, we can make a useful and
    simplifying assumption. This is a) that the Milky Way is considered an
    average galaxy in the cosmos\footnotemark and b) the Earth rests at
    approximately the halfway point between the center of the galaxy and it's
    furthest edge (at the radial point $\frac{d}{2}$).

    \footnotetext{This may or may not be the case exactly, and this will be
    discussed at greater length in 3.2.5}

    Conceding these assumptions, we can take the luminosity of an average
    galaxy in terms of the flux originating from the Milky Way that is received
    by the Earth. Doing so results in the following expression.
    \begin{equation}
        L = 4 \pi \phi_e (\frac{d}{2})^2
    \end{equation}
    Where $\phi_e$ is the aforementioned flux of the Milky Way received by the
    Earth. Notably we utilize the standard spherical surface area formula for
    this expression as the curvature of the universe is imperceptible on the
    scales of an individual galaxy and thus considerations of its larger
    topology are unnecessary.

    From here we can utilize equation (7) to find the average pristine light in
    terms of $\phi_e$ and given that we are approximately at $\frac{d}{2}$.
    \begin{equation*}
        F_{\phi}(\rho) = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{A(\rho)}{Q} \; \frac{L}{4 \pi R^3
        \sin(\rho)}  \; d\rho
        = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{A(\rho)}{Q} \; \frac{\pi \phi_e d^2}{4 \pi R^3
        \sin(\rho)}  \; d\rho
    \end{equation*}
    Which results in the following expression.
    \begin{equation}
        F_{\phi}(\rho) = \phi_e \frac{N d^2}{\pi R^3} 
    \end{equation}
    This, then, is the average pristine light $P$ in the cosmos as identified
    in (3).

    \subsubsection{Average Temperature of CMB}
    The tools for calculating the average temperature of the CMB have now been
    derived. The discussion of the average pristine and residual light in the
    cosmos has been conducted and the relationship between the two has given us
    an explicit way to calculate the total flux of light in the cosmos. Given
    expression (3), we can now substitute the calculated values of $P$ and
    $\alpha$ to see that the net flux of the CMB arriving at the Earth is
    simply $\phi_e$.
    \begin{equation*}
        P\alpha^{-1} = \phi_e \frac{N d^2}{2R^3} \left[\frac{N d^2}{2
        R^3}\right]^{-1} = \phi_e
    \end{equation*}
    The uniqueness of this result cannot be overstated. Due to the form of the
    calculations conducted we see that the terms relating to the radius of the
    $\mathbb{S}^3$ manifold, the number count of galaxies, and the radius of
    the average galaxy, all drop out of our expression and leave us with
    $\phi_e$. Of course, this varies under considerations of our assumptions.
    For instance, our position in the Milky Way could be closer to
    $\frac{3}{4}d$ which would alter our solution accordingly. For the purposes
    of a zeroth order calculation, however, we will consider $\frac{d}{2}$ to
    suffice.

    The question, now, is how to acquire the average temperature of the CMB
    from all of this. 

    In 3.2.1 it is shown that the CMB in the CCM is taken to be a perfect black
    body spectrum. As such, we can utilize the Stefan-Boltzmann equation to
    determine the temperature of the radiative flux density of a black body
    spectrum.
    \begin{equation}
        J = \sigma T^4 \longrightarrow {T=\left[\frac{J}{\sigma}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}}
    \end{equation}
    For $J$, the radiative flux density which here we take to be $\phi_e$, 
    $\sigma$ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($5.67 × 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2
    K^4}$), and $T$ the temperature\footnotemark. 

    \footnotetext{It should be noted that the more general expression of the
        Stefan-Boltzmann relation includes the factor of $\epsilon$ or
        emissivity. However, the emissivity of a perfect black body is simply 1.}

    %Determination of the precise radiative flux density of the Milky Way galaxy
    %as detected on Earth is highly non-trivial in general, however certain data
    %is available. In \textit{The surface brightness of the Galaxy at the solar
    %neighbourhood}, the optical surface brightness of the Milky Way is
    %determined utilizing various optical and infra-red surveys to obtain one of
    %the few modern, multi-wavelength estimates. Melchoir et al
    %compare various estimates sets as the USNO-A2 Pioneer $10/11^a$ while also
    %utilizing their own unique determination via data sets like Hipparcos and
    %COBE/DIRBE\cite{melchoir}. 

    %The estimations offered in \cite{melchoir} offer a wide set of data points
    %for the surface brightness of the Milky Way varying from as low as $2.433\;
    %W/m^{-2}$ up to $10.34\;W/m^{-2}$. Utilizing the two extremal points of the
    %data offered by Melchoir yields values ranging from $2.559$ K up to
    %$3.675$ K in comparison to the experimentally accepted temperature of
    %$2.725$ K \cite{fixsen}

    %\subsubsection{Luminosity Considerations}
    %Given the difficulty of determining the radiative flux of the Milky Way in
    %the solar neighborhood it may prove advantageous to consider conducting the
    %above calculations from the perspective of luminosity.

    \subsection{CMB Power Spectrum}
    The CMB Power Spectrum is an equally important characteristic of the CMB  

    basically need to link discussion of residual light to this sort of
    simulation approach to the problem. layout the basic idea of separation of
    the clusters and breakdown of structures then show plots then discuss
    sensitivity and whatnot.
